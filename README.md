# MNIST -Neural network project

This repository presents a neural network implementation tailored for MNIST digit classification,using two hidden layer neural network which i build on the one hidden layer neural network .Initially guided by Samson Zang's approach for one hidden layer and I subsequently extended to feature two hidden layers, each comprising 10 nodes. The project structure includes source code in it, where two_hidden_layers.py encapsulates the two-hidden-layer architecture. Dataset is also uploaded in the repo. Execution of the training script, two_hidden_layers.py, facilitates model training and subsequent evaluation on the MNIST test set, with accuracy metrics displayed post-training. The model architecture consists of an input layer of 784 nodes, followed by two hidden layers, each housing 10 nodes, and an output layer with 10 nodes corresponding to digits 0-9.
